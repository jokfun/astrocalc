Application's instructions

SIMILARITY

Injective mapping between attributes of a source relation 
and a target relation.
In order to find the best matching, the method used is the
Hungarian algorithm.
Default seed : 100
Default percent (amount of data used) : 100

AGREGATE

Agregation between 2 files, the application will find the best
match of a source's tuple with a target's tuple by using a
distance method. The best match of a tuple has the minimal
distance with its test. 
Default distance method : Min Max

MULTIAGREGATE

Create the agregation between all tuples of a source with all
tuples of a target. For each comparison, it'll return an array
of the respective distance of each attribute.
Default distance method : Min Max

--------------------------------------------------------------

FILE FORMAT

The input file must be csv file.
Each line of a file must have 12 columns separate with a comma
Columns: id mag_r u-g g-r r-i i-z z_spec feat1 feat2 feat3 feat4 feat5
id: SDSS ObjID
mag_r: dered_r magnitude
u-g to i-z: respective dereddened colours
z_spec: spectroscopic redshift
feat1: mag_r normalized to have 0 mean and 1 stdev
feat2: u-g colour normalized similarly
feat3: g-r colour normalized similarly
feat4: r-i colour normalized similarly
feat5: i-z colour normalized similarly

DISTANCE METHODS

You can add/delete/modify all the distance methods in the file :
functionAgreg.py
For example, adding a new method
1 - Add the name of the function in the name_agregation method
2 - Add the name of the method in the dictionnary of the 
    function_agregation method
3 - Create the method of the distance :
	1st arg : source (array)
	2nd arg : target (array)
	3rd arg : priority (array)
	4th arg : tab (boolean)
		  if you want to return the sum of the value
		  (AGREGATE) or an array of each value (MULTIAGREGATE)

PRIORITY

The priority input can give different priority for each attribute
Default priority is 1;1;1;1;1 (string) which gives equal priority
for each attributes.
The priority depends on the distance method used.

Format of the priority :
1;1;1;1;1 = default
1 2 3 4 5 = space can replace ;
1;2 3 4;5 = works too
1;2       = the 3 missing values will be 1 (default)
1 2 3 4 5 6 = after 5 values, the rest will be ignored
Two different ways to write decimals : 1.3 or 1,3

WARNING

If the application freezes there is no problem, with large amount of data,
the different algorithms used can take time.

Be careful of your ram capacity while working on large amount of data
